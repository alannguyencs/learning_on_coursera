### JavaScript in the browser
JavaScript **modules**:
+ Modules allow for code to be reused and more easily replaced.
+ Modules were added to ECMAScript ES6 specification.
+ To use an ES6 module in browser, you need to set the script type attribute to "module".

**Document Object Model** (DOM) is the framework that a browser uses to read and store and webpage. The **DOM** allows you to change properties of objects on a webpage.

JavaScript's initial purpose was to provide interactivity in the browser. In other words, it was the "set of controls" that would allow web developers to control the behavior of the webpages and even the browsers that these webpages worked on.

JavaScript **selectors** work with the document object which you can access by typing the keyword document.
