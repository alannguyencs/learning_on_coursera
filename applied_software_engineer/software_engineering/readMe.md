##  Overview of Software Engineering
### Software Engineering
+ Software engineering is the systematic approach to the design and developement software
+ Responsibilities of a software engineering includes:
    + Designing, building, and maintaining software systems
    + Writing and testing code
    + Consluting with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members
+ Software engineers build systems while software developers implement specific functionalities

### Software development life cycle
+ SDLC provides a systematic process for software development
+ SDLC advantages include:
    + Risk reduction and improved efficiency
    + Facilitates communication
    + Team members know their responsibilities
    + Iteration allows for changing requirements
+ SDLC phases:
    1. Planning: requirement gathering, create software requirement specification
    2. Design: develop architecture, create design doc
    3. Development: coding
    4. Testing: identify and fix bugs
    5. Development: code released to production environment
    6. Maintenance: stakeholder feedback, issues/ bugs identified, code enhancements suggested

### Building quality software
+ Requirement gathering is collecting and documenting the set of requirements that the software needs to adhere to
+ Designing transforms requirements into a structure that developers can use
+ Coding for quality entails following a set of coding practices during development
+ Testing is the process of verifying that the software matches established requirements and is free of bugs
+ Release types include alpha, beta, and general availability
+ Documenting requires text and video that explains the software to technical and non-technical users

### Requirements
+ The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting, documenting, confirming, and then prioritizing documents
+ The SRS documents functional, external, system, and non-functional requirements
+ The URS documents user stories
+ The SysRS documents system capabilities and acceptance criteria, and policy, regulation, personel, performance, security, and hardware requirements.

## Software Building Process and Associated Roles
### Software Development Methodologies
+ Three common methodologies are Waterfall, V-shape model, and Agile
+ Waterfall and V-shape are sequential while Agile is iterative
+ Waterfall and V-shape are easy to use but neither accomodates chaning requirements well
+ Agile allows for changing requirements but resource allocation can be challenging

### Software Testing
+ Classification 1:
    + functional
    + non-functional
    + regression (maintenance)
+ Classification 2:
    + unit testing: verifies small, independent chucks of code
    + integration testing: looks for errors when two or more chunks of code are combined
    + system testing: validates the system as fully completed product
    + acceptance testing: verifies implementation of user requirements and business processes

### Software Documentation
+ Documentation can be in written, video, or graphical format
+ Process documentation (answer how): describes how to complete a task
+ Product documentation (answer what): relates to how a product functions
+ Types of product documentation: requirements, design, technical, QA, and user
+ Standard operating procedures (SOPs): are written instruction detailing an organization-specific procedure.

### Others:
+ Software engineering: the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software
+ SDLC: gives dev teams a process to follow to improve efficiency and reduce risks
+ Maintenance phase: fixing minor user interface issues
+ Beta release: meets all functional requirements
+ SRS: contains functional, external interface, and non-functional requirements
